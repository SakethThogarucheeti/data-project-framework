# Data Project Framework
A High-level Conceptual Framework to aid in working on Data-related Projects.

### Acknowledgements
This repository is largely inspired from [Abhishek Thakur's ML Framework Repo](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/mlframework). 

### Dataset Used
The dataset used for applying this framework is the [Graduate Admission 2 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions) available on Kaggle.

### What each directory means
* dataset : All raw and cleaned data is stored here
* notebooks : Contains Jupyter notebooks for EDA, Data Storytelling etc.
* src : Contains Python scripts used predominantly for predictive modelling
* utils : Contains utility scripts to aid in faster analysis
* models : All trained models are stored here (as .pkl files)
* output : Contains output files (submissions, images, reports etc.)

### Using the Repo
The Repository's directory structure can be used to guide your own data science and machine learning projects.
